## Notes

1. I have no experience in coding. I coded for a couple months 10 years ago for calculation, it's far different from making things like this. And rails, postgresql, gems, heroku and specialy git are complicated, super!
2. I code with a Windows laptop. That not many coders out there work in Windows environment means there are not many solutions I can google for when getting stuck.
3. I have a full-time job. And since the deadline is so close, there is no time to read books provided. I read a half of a book (Learn to program - Chris Pine) only.
4. I have a terrible misspelling problem. ahhhhhhh, I hate this.
